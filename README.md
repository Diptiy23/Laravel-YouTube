Firstly, I chose to work on Laravel framework of Php.
In Laravel Folder structure, I have created view file, which has Textbox and Button for YouTube video search.
Then I have created YouTube Developer Key to access YouTube API. then I created Controller, js, config files, Routes files for this project.
I chose Javascript as my frontend for Ajax call to get a response.
